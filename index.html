            me and my three siblings. As for my father,
             he worked hard to make sure his family had a roof over their heads. 
            With this opportunity to
            have an education,
             and this is why I have sought out and joined this program over the summer because coding is something that has always
            intrested me, but I've never known where to start, 
            and this place has been a great starting point for me.
